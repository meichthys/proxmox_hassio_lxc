# Hass.io in Proxmox LXC container

Many benefits can be gained by using a LXC container compared to a VM. The resources needed to run a LXC container are less than running a VM. Modifing the resouces assigned to the LXC container can be done without having to reboot the container. The serial devices connected to Proxmox can be shared with multiple LXC containers simulatenously.
